### What is TypeScript

TypeScript is a syntactic superset of JavaScript which adds static typing.

This basically means that TypeScript adds syntax on top of JavaScript, allowing developers to add types.

### Why TypeScript

JavaScript is a loosely typed language. It can be difficult to understand what types of data are being passed around in JavaScript.

In JavaScript, function parameters and variables don't have any information! So developers need to look at documentation, or guess based on the implementation.

TypeScript allows specifying the types of data being passed around within the code, and has the ability to report errors when the types don't match.

For example, TypeScript will report an error when passing a string into a function that expects a number. JavaScript will not.

### About this site

To teach more people to use TypeScript including basic and advanced usage, we create this site which provides some problems should be solved by TypeScript. And part of the answers of the problems could be found at [official TypeScript document](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

This problem require you to export a type which equals to string `Hello, world`.

Now, you can go to the editor at right of the page to start your TypeScript travel.
